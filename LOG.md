# 📓 From Zero to Python — Learning Journal

This is my personal record of daily learning. Each day includes a short summary of what I worked on, what I learned, and what I plan to improve. Mistakes included. Growth guaranteed.

## ✅ Day 1 — Task Manager (Lists, Input/Output)

📅 **Date:** 27/06/2025  
📁 **Project:** `days/day01_task_manager/task_manager.py`

### 📌 Focus:
- Learn basic list operations
- Use `input()` to interact with the user
- Practice loops with `for` and `enumerate()`
- Implement simple conditionals with `if` and `else`

### 🔍 What I learned:
- How to create and update lists in Python using `.append()` and `.pop()`
- How to loop over elements with indexes using `enumerate()`
- How to safely remove an item from a list by validating the index
- That `input()` always returns a string — so converting to `int` is essential when working with numbers
- The use of \n to jump a line

### ⚠️ Challenges:
- Understanding zero-based indexing and how to adjust it when displaying options to users

### 🧠 Reflections:
This was my first real Python script and it felt great to see a working CLI program. It's simple, but functional — and I already started thinking about making it modular and saving data to a file.
