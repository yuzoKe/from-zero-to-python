# 📓 From Zero to Python — Learning Journal
This is my personal record of daily learning. Each day includes a short summary of what I worked on, what I learned, and what I plan to improve. Mistakes included. Growth guaranteed.

# ✅ Day 1 — Task Manager (Lists, Input/Output)
📅 Date: 27/06/2025
📁 Project: days/day01_task_manager/task_manager.py

## 📌 Focus:
* Learn basic list operations
* Use input() to interact with the user
* Practice loops with for and enumerate()
* Implement simple conditionals with if and else

## 🔍 What I learned:
* How to create and update lists in Python using .append() and .pop()
* How to loop over elements with indexes using enumerate()
* How to safely remove an item from a list by validating the index
* That input() always returns a string — so converting to int is essential when working with numbers
* The use of \n to jump a line

## ⚠️ Challenges:
Understanding zero-based indexing and how to adjust it when displaying options to users

## 🧠 Reflections:
This was my first real Python script and it felt great to see a working CLI program. It's simple, but functional. I already started thinking about making it "tangible" and saving data to a file.

# ✅ Day 2 — GUI Task Manager (First time with Tkinter!)
📅 Date: 29/06/2025
📁 Project: days/day02_gui_task_manager/

## 📌 What I tried to do:
* Make a visual version of yesterday's task manager
* Learn about windows and buttons (Tkinter)
* Figure out how to save tasks so they don't disappear

## 🔍 What I actually learned:
* Classes are confusing but useful: Still don't fully get self but I see it organizes code better
* Tkinter basics: Made a window with buttons! Took forever to figure out pack()
* Saving data: Used JSON - basically a text file that looks like Python dictionaries
* Buttons do things: Connecting command=function_name was magical when it worked

## 😅 Honest struggles:
* Spent 2 hours trying to understand why my button wasn't working
* Classes vs functions - still mixing them up
* Error messages everywhere until I added try/except (copied from examples)
* The code is mostly working but I don't understand every single line

## 🎉 Cool things that worked:
* You can actually check off tasks!
* Tasks keep saved when you close the program (mind blown)
* Delete button works (with confirmation so I don't delete by accident)
* Changed colors to make it look less ugly

## 🤔 Things I copy-pasted and need to understand better:
* The scrollbar part (it works but... how?)
* Lambda functions - used them but still googling what they do
* Some of the layout code
* Error handling - I know it's important but added it blindly

## 🧠 Honest reflection:
This feels like a huge jump from yesterday! The GUI actually looks like a real program. Got help from AI/tutorials for the complex parts, but I typed every line and tested everything. Still have no idea how some parts work, but how I said, I believe in learning by doing.
The best part: when I showed it to my family, they said "wow, you made that?!", felt good.

## 🎯 Tomorrow I want to:
* Actually understand what self means
* Add simple features without copying code
* Try colors or fonts
* Read more about classes
