# From Zero to Python 🚀

Welcome to my journey of learning Python from absolute zero.

This repository is a personal log of daily learning, small projects, and consistent growth in programming — especially geared toward my journey as a Computer Engineering student.

## 📍 Goals:
- Practice Python every day
- Build real, hands-on projects
- Track my growth with daily commits

---

## 📂 Structure:
- `days/`: daily project folders
- `LOG.md`: my learning journal
