# 🐍 From Zero to Python — My Journey as a Computer Engineer

Hi! I'm Eduardo, a Computer Engineering student at UNIVESP, São Paulo, Brasil. 

This repository documents my personal journey of learning Python from scratch, building real projects, and understanding how software truly works.

Before this, my only programming experience was with VBA (Excel macros). Now, I'm diving into Python with curiosity and I'm very excited.

I believe the best way to learn is by practicing daily, reviewing consistently, and sharing openly — and that’s exactly what I aim to do here.
